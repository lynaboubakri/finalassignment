# Music Recommender (C++)

This is a simple Spotify-style recommender system developed for our group project.  
- Users choose a genre (Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Kids, Top 2025).  
- They also choose a year interval (1975–1999, 2000–2011, 2011–2020, 2021–2025, Top 2025).  
- The program then randomly recommends a song with title, artist, year, and views.  
- Users can request another recommendation, pick a new genre, or exit.  

## How to run
Compile with: g++ -std=c++11 -o MusicRecommender finalassignment/finalassignment.cpp
